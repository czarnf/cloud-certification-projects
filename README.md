# Cloud Certification Projects

## Overview

This repository showcases a collection of cloud-based projects designed to demonstrate practical knowledge and hands-on experience with popular cloud platforms, including **AWS** and **Azure**. Each project is aligned with foundational cloud certifications, such as **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01)** and **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)**, providing real-world scenarios and solutions.

The repository is structured to help potential employers or collaborators assess proficiency in cloud computing concepts, deployment automation, security, and management using industry-standard tools.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two main sections, each focusing on a cloud platform:

### 1. **AWS Projects**
   - Located under the `aws-projects` directory.
   - Highlights foundational AWS services, such as EC2, S3, IAM, and more.
   - Examples include deploying virtual servers, securing cloud environments, and setting up lifecycle management for resources.

### 2. **Azure Projects**
   - Located under the `azure-projects` directory.
   - Focuses on essential Azure services, including Storage Accounts, Virtual Machines, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
   - Projects emphasize automation, cost optimization, and best practices for managing Azure resources.
